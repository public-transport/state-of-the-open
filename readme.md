# the state of open public transport

This is a **community-led assessment of open data & open services for public transport**, broken up by city. It intends to give

- politicians and policy-makers an overview on what needs to be done
- raise awareness for the importance of open, machine-readable transit data
- scientists and programmers a feeling what is (im)possible with the local data
